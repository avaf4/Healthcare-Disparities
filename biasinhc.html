    <h1 class="contntpg">Biases in Healthcare</h1>
<p>There are several biases in healthcare that result in malpractice and almost $93 billion dollars in unneccesary medical costs. The groups effected by this bias include (but aren't limited to) BIPOC, disabled, older, LGBTQ+, and overweight people.</p>


    <div class="homecontainer1">
      <div class="home">
        <h5>BIPOC</h5>
       <p class="biastxt">Everyone has inherent biases, and doctors aren't void of this. In fact, 40% of first and second year medical students hold the belief that black people have thicker skin than other races. This results in black paitents being 22% less likely to recieve pain medication than their white counterparts. Indigenous Americans and Black Americans have a maternal death rate of more than quadruple that of White Americans. Asian Americans are less likely to be diagnosed with mental illnesses, despite showing symptoms, possibly due to the model minority myth. Also, Black and Latine children were less likely to admitted to the hospital after being visiting the emergency room. </p>

        <h5>LGBTQ+ & Women</h5>
       <p class="biastxt1">A study found that more than 80% of medical students had an implicit bias against LGBTQ+ people. This has led to underdiagnosis of numerous illnesses such as cardiovascular disease, obesity, and asthma. Studies have also shown that many medical professionals view cis women as time-consuming and hysterical and such biases are reflected onto transgender women and people alike. These biases lead to paitients avoiding care all together.</p>

    <div class="home">
      <h5 id="biashdr">Disabled + Older + Overweight</h5>
     <p class="biastxt2">Many healthcare physicians hold the belief that older patients are more likely to be demanding, helpless, and unwilling to receive treatment which can impair diagnosis and cause for a lower quality of life for older people. Similarly, overwieght patients are viewed in a negative light by healthcare workers as unwilling to follow recommendations, unlikely to stick to treatments, and lazy. When addressing health problems, they are more likely to be told to "lose weight" rather than recieve proper care to address said problem. Ableism is also prevalent in healthcare as even healthcare buildings can be inaccessible to those who use wheelchairs or other mobility devices (for instance, not providing proper ramps or elevators where needed). Around 83% of medical professionals in a study prefered to work with able-bodied people which is quite biased and could lead to the emergence of secondary conditions.</p>
